# loadcurrent

loadcurrent takes a json stream generated by either dumpcurrent or the Cardinal
EVM statedump subcommand, and loads it into a BadgerDB database according to
the Current Storage schema.

This is used to generate a Cardinal database from a Geth backup, or, in some
circumstances, a Cardinal database using a different storage engine.

Usage:

```
cat backupfile | ./loadcurrent /path/to/badgerdb
```
